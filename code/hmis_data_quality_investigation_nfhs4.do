use ".\UttarPradeshNeoNatalHealth\data\nfhs4_files\IABR74FL.DTA""

generate wgt = sv005/1000000

label variable "state women's sample weight, decimalized"

* This table looks at the per-state means of state sample weight, which I would 
* expect to be 1.
table v024, c(mean wgt)

* Note that the numbers associated with the places came from the accompanying DO file
gen place_of_dlv = "home" if inlist(m15, 10, 11, 12, 13)
replace place_of_dlv = "public" if inlist(m15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27)
replace place_of_dlv = "private" if inlist(m15, 30, 31, 32, 33)
replace place_of_dlv = "other" if m15 == 96

label variable place_of_dlv "place of delivery; fewer, more-general categories"

tab v024 place_of_dlv [iweight=wgt]

* This table looks at the per-state means of state sample weight for those 
* observations with place of delivery specified to see if weights still work
keep if m15 != .
