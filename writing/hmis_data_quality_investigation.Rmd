## The Question

Email 1

> The last NFHS was in 2015.  In the decade before, hospital birth increased dramatically from 40% to 80%.  Has it further increased since?  The only data source that *might* help answer this is health monitoring system (HMIS) data from the government.  But we don't know how reliable it is.  If someone cleans and organizes the HMIS data, it could be matched to NFHS-4 data to see whether it reliably reported the proportion of hospital births in different places in 2015.  (It probably did not reliably report deaths.)  If it did, then let's see what it says about the proportion of births that took place in hospitals in 2019 and see if we trust it.

> This is substantially going to be a task of assessing data quality -- do these data make any sense?  Do some indicators or states make sense but not others? Whatever you end up learning about it will be useful because I have other colleagues who work on health in India who are interested in it to.  

> I'm also interested in a very specific question: do the numbers on place of delivery (proportion of babies born at home, in public hospitals, and private hospitals) in the HMIS match a high quality sample survey (the NFHS-4)?  

> To get started, I shared a google drive folder that contains HMIS (health monitoring information system) data on maternal and child health.  Here are some steps.  

> Download 2014-2015 data.  

> First figure out whether it seems to be cumulative throughout the year or quarterly data?  One thing that is annoying is that there are a lot of repeat file names which might make working with these spreadsheets more difficult.  

> Once you'd figured the data out a bit, compute the proportion of births it claims occurred in private, public, and at home in each state for 2014-15.  

> Then download and open the NFHS-4.  Look at place of birth (using weights of course) for 2014-15 births.  You'll have to code the place of birth variable yourself based on a wider set of categories, but it should not be too hard.  
 
> Compare the two data sources.  Does the HMIS match the NFHS?  (could you make a graph or a table to show it?)  

> If so, could you please look at what fraction of births happen at home, private, and public in each state in 2018-2019 in the HMIS?  

> If, along the way, you find other interesting things, please let me know.  (One thing is that I think the HMIS basically does not report neonatal mortality.)

## HMIS Data Characteristics

The HMIS data is provided in two explicit levels of aggregation: at the district level and at the sub-district level. For the purpose of investigating the quality of HMIS data compared to NFHS-4 data, we will use the district-level data.

For the year 2014-2015, the data is provided **cumulatively** each quarter. That is, data is available for the periods

* from April 2014 to June 2014 -- the first quarter of Indian fiscal year (FY) 2014-2015 -- in the directory "MonthUpToJune",
* from April 2014 to September 2014 -- the first two quarters of FY 2014-2015 -- in the directory "MonthUpToSeptember",
* from April 2014 to December 2014 -- the first three quarters of FY 2014-2015 -- in the directory "MonthUpToDecember", and
* from April 2014 to March 2015 -- all of FY 2014-2015 -- in the directory "MonthUpToMarch".

Within each of the quarterly directories, there are yet more directories for each of the Indian states containing district- or sub-district-level data. There is also a directory with data aggregated to the state level, which is what we will use for comparison to NFHS-4 data. The file from which we'll extract the data has the following address: "./nrhm_files/district/2014-2015/MonthUpToMarch/_ALL INDIA/All.xls" 

The HMIS reports 166 indicators. The indicator columns are color-coded: white for counts and gray for percentages. Those we care about are called "Number of Home deliveries", "Deliveries Conducted at Public Institutions", "Institutional deliveries (Public Insts.+Pvt. Insts.)", and "Total reported deliveries".

I find these per-state percentages for place of delivery.

## NFHS-4 Data Characteristics

I downloaded the Births Recode data from the DHS website as linked from the NFHS-4 webpage. It reports 1,315,617 observations of 1,340 variables. Those we care about are called "v005" for overall sample weight, "sv005" for state sample weight, "b3" for the century month code for the date of birth of the child, "m15" for place of delivery, and "v024" for state.

One interesting thing: I've never worked with survey data before, but I would've expected the per-state means of the state sample weights to equal 1 (or 10^6^, since the state sample weight variable contains six decimal places without a decimal point). Instead, the means range from 91% to 113%. The per-state means of state sample weights for those observations with place of birth specified have a similar range.

## Comparison Plots

Plots comparing the two data sources' accounts of percentage of babies delivered at home, at public institutions, or at private institutions are presented below.

I had to do an unfortunate amount of manual manipulation of the data structures in order to get these plots, which may have introduced some errors.

> That is actually not as far from the NFHS as I would have expected considering that government employees who report to the HMIS have an incentive to over-report the number of births in their facilities in order to get more supplies, staff, etc.  And private facilities have an incentive to under-report because local authorities might close them down or extract bribes.

> So, maybe it is worth looking at the HMIS for 2018-2019.  The amount by which it is wrong is not likely to be higher than it was in 2014 since that have been efforts to monitor hospitals in other domains that could have spilled over into improving reporting.

> Would it be possible to let me know for the following places what proportion of births in the HMIS in 2018-19 happened in public, private, and home?  The regions I'm interested in are:

> 1. Uttar Pradesh
> 2. all India
> 3. Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh as if it were one region (the reason is that these states, plus Uttar Pradesh used to be called "BIMARU" (which is a derogatory term meaning "sick" that isn't politically correct), but in neonatal health this group seems to have improved faster than UP.  Part of the work of the book is trying to understand why Uttar Pradesh has lagged behind states that used to be considered its "peers" on social, economic and health indicators.)
> 4. Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telegana as if they were one region (this is "south India", which is culturally distinct from the north and typically has better health outcomes)
